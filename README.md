Parking Spot Finder is a Kotlin-based Android application built using the Jetpack Compose UI toolkit and Google Maps. The app allows users to find and locate available parking spots in their vicinity, making it convenient for them to navigate and park their vehicles.

## Features

- View available parking spots on the map with markers.
- Get detailed information about each parking spot, such as address, distance, and pricing.
- Filter parking spots based on criteria like distance, availability, and price.
- Navigate to the selected parking spot using Google Maps directions.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The application is developed using the Kotlin programming language, known for its concise syntax and strong type safety.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Jetpack Compose is used for building the user interface, providing a declarative and modern approach to UI development.
- **Google Maps**: The Google Maps API is integrated into the application to display the map, markers, and provide location-based services.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which separates the logic for data handling and UI presentation.
- **Marker**: The marker feature of Google Maps is used to represent and visualize parking spots on the map.
